It hurts to know that we can't visit them during these stressful times when they need the social comfort the most. That's why we wanted to create a solution that allows for a sense of community. Thus we made Apartly - you might be physically apart, but not socially. You're just Apartly! Apartly provides an easy platform for the elderly to find communities and similar hobby interest groups and join/host Zoom calls with them. With a simple UI, anyone can use it to find a group of people who all just want to hang virtually!",
